Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis & K-Means Clustering 🛍️

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis and K-Means Clustering. The goal is to identify different customer groups, such as loyal customers, at-risk customers, and potential customers, to improve marketing strategies for e-commerce and retail businesses.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the Online Retail Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes transactions of a UK-based online retailer with features like InvoiceNo, CustomerID, InvoiceDate, Quantity, UnitPrice, etc.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn)
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Machine Learning (RFM Analysis, K-Means Clustering)
Data Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)

📊 Key Steps & Approach
✔ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering (creating TotalPrice), and data transformation.
✔ RFM Analysis: Calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
✔ Customer Segmentation: Using K-Means Clustering to categorize customers into different groups.
✔ Visualization: Scatter plots to analyze customer distribution.
✔ Business Insights & Applications:

Loyal Customers → High frequency, high spending → Offer loyalty rewards.
At-Risk Customers → High recency, low spending → Send discount offers.
Potential Customers → Moderate frequency & spending → Encourage repeat purchases.
